# Bjastkuliar's Minecraft Resource Pack
## Disclaimer
A simple texture pack that I often use. I do not own any of the files, which all belong to the respetive owners (namely Mojang, OptiFine, Tirenay and Rexus).
## Content
This pack is a simple merge of Rexus' Real nature (which is in turn an adaptation of Tirenay's own version) with a simple overriding of some of Minecraft's Music Discs with some custom music.<br>
The track overriding contains:
- Infinite Amethist by Lena Raine as music_disc_13
- Ancestry by Lena Raine as music_disc_blocks
- Left to Bloom by Lena Raine as music_disc_mellohi
- Ordinary Day by Yumi Kimura as music_disc_stal
- Non ho l'et√† by Gigliola Cinquetti as music_disc_chirp
- and others...
